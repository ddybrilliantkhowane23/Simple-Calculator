# Simple Calculator App 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been used to create this simple, beginner-friendly web based calculator. Include a functional percentage (%) button and it runs fundamental math calculations. As I develop into a professional software developer, this project which is also part of my path as a first-year BSc IT student builds and refines actual projects for my GitHub portfolio.

# Features 
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Percentages determined
Clear display function
Responsive and simple to use interface

# Technologies Used

Vanilla JavaScript

# Objectives
One of the first measures I take in my hands-on learning path is this one. I'm utilizing it to:
Raise my frontend abilities.
Create a robust GitHub portfolio for fellowships and internships.
Demonstrate a passion for software development and dedication.

# What I took away from this
JavaScript DOM modification
managing graceful input and mistakes
Arrangement of neat, easily maintainable code
